## Syntax

```java
ANIMATION_TARGET Animation_ID
```

- **`Animation_ID`** : The integer ID of an animation.

## Examples

```java
// TODO: Examples
```

## Notes

- If the player does not have a target, this command will do nothing. See **[the TARGET_SET command](./commands.md#target_set)** for more information.
- You can find an animation ID by using Kittykeys -> Settings -> Print events to chat, or by using Dev tools -> Player or NPCs (if using dev tools, _A_ holds the current animation ID).
